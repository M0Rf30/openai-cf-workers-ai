- **Validate (Lint & Unit Tests):** `npm run validate`

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Semicolons:** Always use semicolons.
- **Trailing Commas:** Use trailing commas for multi-line object and array literals (ES5 style).
- **Line Length:** Max 120 characters.
- **Variable Declaration:** Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- **Unused Variables:** Avoid unused variables; variables starting with `_` are ignored.
- **Error Handling:** Follow existing patterns in `utils/errors.js`.
- **Naming Conventions:** Adhere to existing camelCase for variables and functions.
- **Imports:** Use consistent import styles as seen in `routes/` and `utils/` files.
- **Function Comments:** Add JSDoc comments for exported functions with parameters and return types.
- **Type Checking:** Use JSDoc for type annotations where needed.

## Model Management

- **Model Context Windows:** Refer to `utils/models.js` for context window information.
- **Model Categories:** Models are organized by capabilities in `utils/models.js`.
- **Model Mappings:** OpenAI-compatible model names are mapped in `utils/models.js`.

## Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests:** Located in `tests/unit/` with corresponding `.test.js` files.
- **Integration Tests:** Located in `tests/integration/`.
- **Test Fixtures:** Use files in `tests/fixtures/` for test data.
- **Test Scripts:** Use scripts in `scripts/` for running specific test scenarios.

## API Routes

- **Route Handlers:** Each route has its own file in `routes/`.
- **Utilities:** Shared functionality is in `utils/`.
- **Validation:** Input validation is handled in `utils/validation.js`.
